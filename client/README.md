<!-- # React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh -->

In this Personal Finance Manager project, frontend code is inside the client folder & backend code is inside server folder.

In my MERN stack project, Personal Finance Manager, users can register and log in. Registration data is stored in MongoDB, while login credentials are verified for authentication. After logging in, users are redirected to the home page, where they can add transactions using the "Add Transaction" button. All transactions are saved in the database and displayed on the User Interface in a table format with sorting functionality. Users can filter transactions by "All", "Expenses", or "Income". The system also allows users to delete transactions or edit them, updating the information in MongoDB after saving. Additionally, users can set a budget and view financial reports for better expense management.
